# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is a hands-on machine learning notebook where I explore and build a classifier to detect breast cancer using public datasets.

## Project Goals
- Load and explore the breast cancer dataset.
- Perform preprocessing and feature selection.
- Build and evaluate a classification model.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), available publicly on Kaggle.

> **Note:** Kaggle API credentials have been removed from this public version.

This notebook was created as part of my learning journey. All code is original and intended for educational purposes.
